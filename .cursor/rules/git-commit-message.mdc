# Git Commit Message Format Standards

## Basic Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

## Subject Line Rules

- Use imperative verb at start (Add, Fix, Update, Remove, etc.)
- Keep concise and clear, under 50 characters
- Do not end with period
- Types include: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore, etc.

## Body Guidelines

- Leave blank line after subject
- Explain "why" this change was made, not just "what" was done
- Keep each line under 72 characters
- List important changes

## Language

- Use English

## Example

```
feat(auth): implement JWT authentication

- Add token generation and validation
- Set up middleware for protected routes
- Update user model to handle tokens

Closes #123
